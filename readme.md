### What is this?

De Boor's Algorithm for Nurbs.

Gaining an intuitive understanding for NURBS is difficult without directly seeing the effects of different control point position, weight vectors, and  knot vectors.

This grasshopper component allows you demonstrate NURBS curves by specifying the degree of the curve, control points, weight vector and the knot vector. 

This allows the user to see NURBS curves in its most general sense.
